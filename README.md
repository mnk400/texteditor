# texteditor
A very basic text editor coded in C in around 200 lines.

Some might say it's very poorly coded purely because of the usage of goto functions(I mean there are other factors too). Well that's sort of true too, but I barely took 30 minutes for this and that's my excuse for it.

Will be working on improving this overtime.
